# Spotify and Deezer Web Scraping Project
As Plato aptly puts it, “Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything”. Inspired by this stunning literature and equipped with the power of Python, we will focus on the music streaming industry players for this project, including Spotify and Deezer. Within the last few years, the popularity of the music streaming platforms has gone through the roof and impacted the entire music industry massively. We will be primarily focusing on the trends in recent years for various songs, artists and playlists that have been streamed over these platforms. We will also focus on finding interesting relationships that can be leveraged by the artists creating the music and the way in which the current listeners consume music.
